How was moss formed?

1.I observed that the kernel is an essential part of an operating system.

2.Furthermore, seeing the microkernel as a type of kernel, I decided to model the code itself from the workings of a microkernel based system.

3.In simulating a microkernel based system, I took into consideration that such a system has host areas where data was handled, called 'servers'.

4.Also  'message passing' takes place. Messaging passing needs to take place so data can be communicated amongst the different servers/data handling hubs.

5.Now, in immitating a microkernel based construct, I made sure to actually code modules that occur in such a construct; 

a.(real life component)servers= (code component)simulated process environment regions,

b.(real life component)message passing= (code component)simulated process environment regions connector activities


6.Now, all that takes place in an environment, or an architecture I coded a simulated process environment where this all takes place.


7.finally I took into consideration that same environment must consist of task handling systems, and tasks to be executed. I also coded structures to simulate these.
a.(real life component)handling system= (code component)simulated task scheduler 

b.(real life component)tasks= (code component)simulated task
